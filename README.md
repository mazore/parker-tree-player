Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
python main.py sequences/spheres.py

Where the arguement is the filename of the sequence csv.

The filename of the coordinates GIFT file (`COORDS_FILENAME`) can be modified at the top of `main.py` but is defaulted to Matt's coordinates

Here's an example of it running `rgb_spheres.csv` (converted from the 2020 christmas tree code)
